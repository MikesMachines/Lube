# Lube recipes and ingredients
Some recipes for personal lubricants along with information about ingredients in commercial lube. 

## General info:
Water based lubes generally use some type of celluose. These tend to clump very easily and take some understanding. First, they are not very soluable in water. They like to attach to themselves (clump) more than they like to hydrate. Its important that they get dispersed in water before hydrating to avoid clumping. 

### If you add it too quickly, you'll get clumps.
### If you add it too slowly, you'll get clumps (there's less water available once they start hydrating, increasing their chances of clumping)

The best way to prevent clumps is to create a slurry before adding to water. This is typically made by adding the cellose to Glycerin or Propylene Glycol. Stirring rapidly for 15s and then pouring it into water.

## Main Ingredient info:
Glycerin
Propylene Glycol

## Recipe - base clear gel
This forms a crystal clear gel. It's a good starting place to build from. MC can be used, but it won't be clear. 

94% Water
4% Propylene glycol
2% HEC

## Enhancing ingredients - stimulating
Most specialty lubes for men focus on numbing, usually with lidocaine. I'd prefer the opposite. 

### Warming / hot

### Cooling

### Carrier
Methyl Nicotinate - rubefacient & vasodiator
Used to make active ingredients trans-dermal. Alone it is a rubefacient and local vasodialotor, turning the skin red and also causing warmth from the increased bloodflow.
