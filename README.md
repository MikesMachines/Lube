# Lube recipes and ingredients
Some recipes for personal lubricants along with information about ingredients in commercial lube. 

General info:
Water based lubes generally use some type of celluose. These tend to clump very easily and take some understanding. First, they are not very soluable in water. They like to attach to themselves (clump) more than they like to hydrate. Its important that they get dispersed in water before hydrating to avoid clumping. 

If you add it too quickly, you'll get clumps.
If you add it too slowly, you'll get clumps (there's less water available once they start hydrating, increasing their chances of clumping)

The best way to prevent clumps is to create a slurry before adding to water. This is typically made by adding the cellose to Glycerin or Propylene Glycol. Stirring rapidly for 15s and then pouring it into water.
