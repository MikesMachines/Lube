# Lube recipes and ingredients (in progress)
Some recipes for personal lubricants along with information about ingredients in commercial lube. 

## General info:
Water based lubes generally use some type of celluose for a thickener / gelling agent. These tend to clump very easily and take some understanding. First, they are not very soluable in water. They like to attach to themselves (clump) more than they like to hydrate. Its important that they get dispersed in water before hydrating to avoid clumping. 

**If you add it too quickly, you'll get clumps.**  
**If you add it too slowly, you'll get clumps.**  

As it starts to hydrate, there is less water available.  The best way to prevent clumps is to create a slurry before adding to water. This is typically made by adding the cellose to Glycerin or Propylene Glycol. Stir rapidly until dispersed.  Pour into water stirring at 140F / 60C.

## Main Ingredient info:
See ingredient page


# Recipes - always test a small amount before using
Recipes are often given in % of the total amount. To make 100mL of lube, 95% water would be 95mL water. See the example base gel.


## Clear gel - a good base to start from
This forms a crystal clear gel. It's a good starting place to build from. MC can be used, but it won't be clear. Adding 3-5 drops of an essential oil can make it warming, tingling, or both.

| Ingredient | Amount |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 90% water | 90mL |
| 5% propylene glycol | 5g  |
| 1.5% HEC | 1.5g  |
| 0.2% Potassium sorbate  | 0.2g  |
| 0.2% sodium benzoate  | 0.2g  |
| Citric acid as needed | vaginal pH ~4 , anal pH ~7 |

Heat the water to 140F with constant stirring
Combine the PG and HEC to create a slurry
Add this to the water - while stirring
Keep stirring at 140F for an hour.
Shut heat off, stirr for 10 min
Test pH, add citric acid to desired pH. You need just a tiny amount. I create a 1% solution of ascorbic acid, and then add drops to desired pH.


## Enhancing ingredients - stimulating

There are a LOT of options here. Essential oils are the easiest. Just a few drops can provide warming / cooling effects. 

Actives (like amino acids) don't do anything on the skin. They need to penetrate / be transdermal. Methyl nicotinate is the best option. It's used in medical formulas. Alone it's a strong local vavasodiator, which means wherever you put it, blood flow will be increased. But it needs to be used in tiny amounts. **Going above 0.05% can cause severe irritation.** 

Nearly all additives will cause the lube to become cloudy.

### Essential oils 
Not very water soluble, but will disperse. Shake before each use. Or mix with a polysorbate.

#### Warming / hot

Wintergreen oil extract - 0.05%

#### Cooling / tingling 

Peppermint Oil Extract - 0.05%

### Carrier
Methyl Nicotinate - extremely strong rubefacient & vasodiator (needs to be diluted to less than 0.05%)
Used to make active ingredients trans-dermal. Alone it is a rubefacient and local vasodialotor, turning the skin red and also causing warmth from the increased bloodflow. 

Most specialty lubes for men focus on numbing, usually with lidocaine. I'd prefer the opposite.
