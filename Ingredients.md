# Lube (in progress)
Supplemental info on ingredients commonly used. 


## Common Ingredient info:


#### Propylene Glycol - You've been consuming this for many years. Like glycerin, it's a very common food ingredient. People consfuse this with ethylene glycol, which is poisonous. 

## Thickeners
#### HEC - Hydroxyethylcellulose  very common cellulose gelling agent, provides slip. Can create perfectly clear gels. 
#### MC - Methyl cellulose. Incredibly inexpensive, food grade. Can create a slimy feel. Clumps very easy. Creates a cloudy product.
#### Xanthan Gum	-	Gelling agent, provides stringiness and body

## Preservatives
### Potassium sorbate  
### Sodium benzoate  
### Citric acid - mostly used to adjust pH 


#### Glycerin - The amount of just completely false info about glycerin astounds me. It absolutely does not cause yeast infections. It is perfectly safe, has been used for decades. All the studies that people reference about pH, osmality, etc. are not done with women. If you're alergic to glycerine you should not use glycerin products. 

## Enhancing ingredients - stimulating

There are a LOT of options here. Essential oils are the easiest. Just a few drops can provide warming / cooling effects. 

Actives (like amino acids) don't do anything on the skin. They need to penetrate / be transdermal. Methyl nicotinate is the best option. It's used in medical formulas. Alone it's a strong local vavasodiator, which means wherever you put it, blood flow will be increased. But it needs to be used in tiny amounts. **Going above 0.05% can cause severe irritation.** 

Nearly all additives will cause the lube to become cloudy.

### Essential oils 
Not very water soluble, but will disperse. Shake before each use. Or mix with a polysorbate.

## Warming / hot
Typically the warm feeling is due to increased blood circulation. 

### Wintergreen oil extract - 0.05%
DO NOT EAT WINTERGREEN. 
Wintergreen is warming and promotes circulation. Anti-inflammatory. Antibacterial. 

### Clove oil
Ayervedic spice considered warming. Anti-inflammatory. Very strong antifungal and antibacterial

## Cooling / tingling 

### Peppermint Essential Oil Extract - 0.05%
The menthol in peppermint has a cooling effect. Very noticable with a slight breeze. Antibacterial.

### Eucalyptus
Eucalyptus wicks water off skin to create a cooling sensation. Great for hot sleepers. Antibacterial.

### Carrier
Methyl Nicotinate - extremely strong rubefacient & vasodiator (needs to be diluted to less than 0.05%)
Used to make active ingredients trans-dermal. Alone it is a rubefacient and local vasodialotor, turning the skin red and also causing warmth from the increased bloodflow. 

Most specialty lubes for men focus on numbing, usually with lidocaine. I'd prefer the opposite.
